# **Hello, Welcome to my first blog post!**

 My name is Marc Aradillas and I have successfully completed the first week at Codeup in the Data Science Cohort class. I have learned more deeply about the field of Data Science. It's fascinating to see what the career domain has in store for aspiring Data Scientist. Codeup has opened up many resources to utilize at our disposal to become successful in accomplishing our first week goals looking into career projections, data science roles, tools, presentations, and the Data Science pipeline!

 I can honestly say it is amazing learning from two great instructors who are experienced and have successfully helped previous students who are now in successful careers as data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, or Machine Learning engineer. 

 The biggest takeaway from week one is the Data Science pipeline. I learned as a data scientist you begin with planning which entails wasking questions and understanding what objectives need to be met for certain problems. The following is Data Acquisition which is a process to retrieve and gatehr information by taking from databases, web scraping, or data importing. Preparation of the data acquired is the next step which involves data tidying, data cleansing, and data wrangling (Train, Validate, Test sets). After prep work comes exploratory data analysis (visualization, feature engineering, feature selection). EDA is the process in which we identify features that have the biggest impact on the target variable. Modeling is the process of utilizing tools like python and its libraries to build visualization or models to map between features and target outcomes. Finally, Delivery! This step in the DS pipeline is where you materialize what you have learned and create a visual or convey the results in a digestible manner to clients, stakeholders, etc. to drive results and solve problems.

 In addition to the data science pipeline we also ended the week in diving into to some command line interface action using the terminal (zshell) to understand how to traverse our local computer file system without the use of a graphical user interface (GUI) or a mouse. The terminal is a powerful tool to learn to use by just using your keyboard commands in the command line one can automate, move, create a robust file system and use git actions to drive work flow with a repository on github.

 As I reflect on the first week I feel as though I can begin calling myself a Data Scientist learning all this new material and applying practice and reading ahead in this course. I look forward to sharing my second full week and dive deep in MySQL and expand on the data science fundamentals.
