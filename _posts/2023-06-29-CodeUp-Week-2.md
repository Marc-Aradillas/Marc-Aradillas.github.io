# Welcome back to my blog series documenting my journey through Code Up's Data Science Cohort!

In this post, I will share my insights from the second week of the program, where we delved into primary indexes, primary keys, and **JOINS** in MySQL.

## Primary Indexes and Primary Keys

One of the key topics we covered during the week was the importance of primary indexes and primary keys in database design. We learned that primary keys are unique identifiers assigned to each record in a table, ensuring their uniqueness and providing a means for efficient data retrieval. In contrast, primary indexes are data structures that support the efficient search and retrieval of data based on the primary key. We discussed the characteristics of primary keys and their significance in establishing relationships between tables. Additionally, we explored the distinction between primary keys and foreign keys, understanding how they contribute to maintaining data integrity in relational databases.

## Understanding the WHERE and HAVING Clauses

Another crucial aspect of SQL that we explored was the proper usage of the WHERE and HAVING clauses. We learned that the WHERE clause is used to filter and manipulate data based on specific conditions. It allows us to extract only the relevant information from the database by applying conditions to the queried features. On the other hand, the HAVING clause is used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause to add conditions to aggregated data. We emphasized the difference between these two clauses and practiced writing queries that effectively utilized both of them.

## Exploring Different Types of JOINS

In the afternoon sessions, we ventured into the fascinating world of JOINS in MySQL. We discussed three commonly used types of JOINS: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN. Each type serves a unique purpose in combining data from multiple tables. The **INNER JOIN** allows us to select records that have matching values in both tables being joined. The LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table and the matching records from the right table. Similarly, the **RIGHT JOIN** returns all records from the right table and the matching records from the left table. We examined examples and compared the results obtained from each type of **JOIN**, gaining a comprehensive understanding of how they can be applied in various scenarios.

## Bridging Tables with Multiple Joins

Furthermore, we dived into the concept of multiple joins, where we use associative tables to connect two tables that do not have a direct relationship. The associative table acts as a bridge between the two tables, establishing relationships with each of them. This technique allows us to retrieve and combine data from disparate tables, enabling more complex data analysis and insights.

# Conclusion

As the second week of the Code Up Data Science Cohort concludes, I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge and practical skills in MySQL and data manipulation. Stay tuned for more updates in the coming weeks as we explore further topics in the exciting field of data science!
