<p>My name is Marc Aradillas, and I have successfully completed the first week at Codeup in the Data Science Cohort class. This week has been an exciting journey into the world of Data Science, where I have gained a deeper understanding of the field and the opportunities it holds for aspiring Data Scientists. Codeup has provided us with a wealth of resources to help us succeed, including career projections, information about various data science roles, tools, presentations, and insights into the Data Science pipeline.</p>
